## RunwayPress

RunwayPress is a Java console-based application that simulates the dynamic world of fashion publishing. Built with object-oriented programming principles, the system models real-world entities such as fashion houses, magazine editors, and critics — all collaborating in the stylish ecosystem of fashion magazines.

Users can create and manage fashion columns, assign them to specific magazines, link them with fashion houses, and allow critics to provide feedback — capturing the essence of editorial workflows in the fashion industry. The application emphasizes structure and relationships, encouraging clean design and thoughtful interaction between objects, just like the coordinated chaos behind every fashion issue.

From high-end couture critiques to emerging designer spotlights, the platform aims to reflect the creative pulse of fashion media. Whether you're simulating a new issue release, connecting with an editor, or managing critiques, RunwayPress is where object-oriented design meets the catwalk.

***Think of it as Vogue meets OOP. Think clean code meets clean lines.***
